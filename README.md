# Interactive-Well-Trajectory-Plot
This open-source code repository provides a Python implementation for generating an interactive well trajectory plot using Plotly. The focus of this code is to visualize the trajectory of Well 15/9-F-5 from the Volve dataset.

## Features
- Interactive visualization: Explore the well trajectory plot with zooming, panning, and hovering capabilities.
- Well trajectory visualization: Display the path of Well 15/9-F-5 in a 3D plot for a comprehensive view of the wellbore path.
- Data integration: Utilize the well trajectory data specifically from the Volve dataset.
- Plot customization: Adjust plot properties, such as colors and line styles, to customize the visualization.
- Easy-to-use: The code provides a straightforward interface for generating the well trajectory plot in Python.

## Note on Interactive Plot
The interactive plot may not be visible when viewing the Jupyter Notebook file directly on GitHub. However, an alternative HTML file (`Well Trajectory Python Code.html`) is included in this repository, showcasing the interactive plot.

To view the interactive plot, follow these steps:

1. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`Well Trajectory.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
3. Run the code in the notebook to generate the interactive plot.
4. The generated plot will be displayed within the Jupyter Notebook interface.

Alternatively, you can directly view the interactive plot by opening the `Well Trajectory.html` file in a web browser without running the Jupyter Notebook. Please note that running the code in a Jupyter Notebook environment is recommended to fully experience the interactivity and functionality of the plot.
